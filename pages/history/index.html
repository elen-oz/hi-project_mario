              Few video games can claim the distinction of being in the general
              consciousness for decades, spanning different generations.
              <strong>Super Mario</strong> is one of, if not the only one, that
              has made great strides in this area.
              <br />
              There's almost no one on the planet who has not heard of the
              Italian plumber in overalls who goes by the name of Mario. Those
              who have never played the game may not be aware of his humble
              beginnings but they have in some shape or form, heard of him.
              <br />

              />
              Mario wasn&#8217;t even the main character in his first appearance
              in the video game. Most importantly, he wasn&#8217;t even a
              plumber and he wasn&#8217;t called Mario. He made his first
              appearance in 1981 in the pioneering arcade game called Donkey
              Kong. The character was called <strong>Jumpman</strong> and he was
              a <strong>carpenter</strong>.

            <p class="section__text text--two-columns">
              Jumpman had to jump over the barrels thrown by Donkey Kong to save
              the damsel in distress who would later be called Princess. Mario
              has come a long way since then. Over the last three decades, he
              has appeared in over two hundred video games and has also been
              referred to in hundreds of more titles.
              <br />
              By the time the 90s rolled around, Mario has become one of the
              most iconic characters in video game history. He not only
              succeeded in rescuing the lady in distress, but he&#8217;d also
              become the face of Nintendo itself.

              The beginning of Nintendo
            </h2>
            <p class="section__text text--two-columns">
              1889 was the year when it all began. Fusajiro Yamauchi established
              a small company named <strong><u>Nintendo Koppai</u></strong> (üîé
              wiki) to manufacture Japanese gambling cards called ‚Äúhanafuda.‚Äù
              Business was great for many decades and the company remained one
              of the top producers of hanafuda in the world.
              <br />
              However, when Hiroshi, Yamauchi&#8217;s grandson, took over the
              business in 1956, he looked for ways that the company could
              diversify its revenue streams. He invested in many things which
              did not always bring profits, such as ‚Äúlove hotels‚Äù which catered
              to amorous couples, rice packets, and a taxi cab company.
              <br />
              He finally found a new niche in the 1960s and gained a stronghold
              on the electronic toys market. When he saw just how Atari
              succeeded, he made it his mission to make it big in the video game
              market.
              <br />
              <strong
                ><u
                  >In 1977, the company introduced the Color TV-Game console.</u
                ></strong
              >
              <br />
              It came preloaded with different versions of one game which was
              initially the company&#8217;s version of Pong. They would go on to
              sell more than 3 million units in the next three years.
              <br />
              The younger Yamauchi wanted more and he turned his attention to
              quarter-munching video arcade games. Nintendo produced 3,000 Radar
              Scope cabinets to be distributed in the United States. However, as
              luck would have it, American arcade vendors thought the game was
              too similar to Space Invaders.
              <br />
              The beeps and noises didn&#8217;t contribute to the game&#8217;s
              general unattractiveness. The company was left with plenty of
              unsold machines and it seemed that their American dreams were
              dashed.
              <br />
              The setback inspired Yamauchi to go back to the drawing board and
              asked artist and product developer Shigeru Miyamoto to create a
              game that would appeal to Americans. Miyamoto focused on the story
              first and taking inspiration from Popeye, he featured a character
              named Jumpman who had to rescue his girlfriend Pauline from a
              giant gorilla kidnapper named Donkey Kong.

              <br />
              He and his brother Luigi, now plumbers from New York, were given
              the task of defeating several creatures who were rising from the
              sewers in the arcade game called Mario Bros.

              >
              <br />
              This came about with the release of the Family Computer in Japan.
              Sales in Japan skyrocketed and after testing in select US
              locations for a year, the Nintendo Entertainment System finally
              penetrated the American market in September 1986. The system was
              launched with more than a dozen games, including a new one that
              would soon become the most recognizable plumber, Super Mario Bros.

                  This was the first game that Mario starred in and his brother
                  Luigi was launched at the same time. There were only slight
                  changes to Mario&#8217;s character and one of them was his
                  nose being less protruded.

                  although it was less than perfect, especially in multiplayer.
                  The difference with this game was that it allowed two players
                  on a kart, one driving it while the other holds on to the
                  back. The players can switch between the two characters at any
                  point.

              Mario has come a long way since he entered our consciousness
              through his general appearance hasn&#8217;t changed much in the
              last two decades. Mario has branched out into sports games, RPGs,
              party games, and more, but he is still predominantly recognized
              for his platform games.
              <br />
              There&#8217;s a reason that Mario is the best-selling gaming
              franchise in history. Although not every game he&#8217;s been on
              turned out to be classics, he&#8217;s always had good reviews and
              he&#8217;s had more hits than misses.
