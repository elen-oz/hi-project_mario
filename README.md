Hi!
This project was made to practice HTML and CSS in different ways. I decided to create a website dedicated to the iconic game - Super Mario.

#### About the Project

This website is all about Super Mario. You can explore the history of Mario, learn about the gameplay, and even listen to some classic Mario tunes.
_Plus, there's a hidden surprise for those who explore a bit_ :)

#### Features

- A cool 8-bit design inspired by the game.

- Navigation to different sections like Home, Gameplay, and History.

- A "Play Game" button for those who want to jump right in.

- Fun animations and GIFs to make the experience lively.

- Background music to set the mood.
