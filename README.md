#### About the Project

The primary objective of this project was to create a website inspired by the 90s, dedicated to a favorite element from that era. I chose the legendary game - Super Mario, which was a significant part of my childhood and the childhood of millions of others around the world.

The website is developed using advanced HTML and CSS techniques, resulting in a structured layout and responsive design optimized for multiple device types, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers.

#### How to Use

Simply clone the repository, and open the index.html file in your browser to explore the website.

```
git clone https://github.com/elen-oz/hi-project_mario.git
cd hi-project_mario
open index.html
```
