              Few video games can claim the distinction of being in the general
              consciousness for decades, spanning different generations. Super
              Mario (ðŸ”Ž<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros."
                >wiki</a
              >) is one of, if not the only one, that has made great strides in
              this area.
              <br />
              There's almost no one on the planet who has not heard of the
              Italian plumber in overalls who goes by the name of Mario. Those
              who have never played the game may not be aware of his humble
              beginnings but they have in some shape or form, heard of him.
              <br />
              Mario wasn&#8217;t even the main character in his first appearance
              in the video game. Most importantly, he wasn&#8217;t even a
              plumber and he wasn&#8217;t called Mario. He made his first
              appearance in 1981 in the pioneering arcade game called Donkey
              Kong. The character was called Jumpman and he was a carpenter.
              <br />

              When playing, the player is assuming the role of Mario and has to
              go through the Mushroom Kingdom. The player has to survive the
              evil forces of the game&#8217;s villain, Bowser, and rescue
              Princess Toadstool. To win the game, Mario has to reach the flag
              pole at the end of each level.
              <br />
              There are coins scattered throughout the game which need to be
              collected. There are also special bricks with question marks that
              reveal more coins and other special items once hit. It&#8217;s a
              must to hit other bricks if there&#8217;s enough time as they
              might contain rare items or coins.
              <br />

              />
              Eating a mushroom transforms regular Marion into Super Mario,
              which means he grows double in size and gets the ability to break
              bricks above him. Careful though as when he gets hit in this mode,
              he reverts to his original self, but he won&#8217;t die.
