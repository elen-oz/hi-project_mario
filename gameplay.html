              When playing, the player is assuming the role of Mario and has to
              go through the Mushroom Kingdom. The player has to survive the
              evil forces of the game&#8217;s villain, Bowser, and rescue
              Princess Toadstool. To win the game, Mario has to
              <u>reach the flag pole</u> at the end of each level.

              There are <u>coins</u> scattered throughout the game which need to
              be collected. There are also special
              <u>bricks with question marks</u> that reveal more coins and other
              special items once hit. It&#8217;s a must to hit other bricks if
              there&#8217;s enough time as they might contain rare items or
              coins.

              transforms regular Mario
              <img src="/img/mini-mario.png" alt="" width="25rem" /> into Super
              Mario <img src="/img/supermario.png" alt="" width="25rem" />,
              which means he grows double in size and gets the ability to break
              bricks above him. Careful though as when he gets hit in this mode,
              he reverts to his original self, but he won&#8217;t die.

              <u>Eating a Fire Flower</u>
              <img src="/img/fireflower.png" alt="" width="25rem" />turns Mario
              into Fire Mario
              <img src="/img/firemario.png" alt="" width="25rem" />and when in
              this form he can throw bouncing fireballs from his hands. Touching
              a bouncing Super Star (also a power-up opportunity) turns him into
              Star Mario.

              In the Star Mario form, there&#8217;s almost nothing that can harm
              him and he can also kill enemies with just one touch. This
              superpower doesn&#8217;t last very long so use it quickly. Players
              start with a specific number of lives that are lost every time
              damage is taken or whenever Mario runs out of time or falls in a
              bottomless pit.

            <p class="text two-columns">
              Jumping on enemies is often the only way to defeat and enemies
              react differently. <u>Koopas</u> are turtle-like creatures and
              they will retract in their shells. <u>Goombas</u> will flatten and
              get defeated while Buzzy Beetles will turn into shells.
              <br />
              You can shoot fire at most enemies and get coins as a reward. The
              game has different worlds and the final stage of each one always
              takes place in a castle where Mario is supposed to fight
              <u>Bowser</u> above a suspension bridge.

                Remember to look for shortcuts as doing so can significantly
                shorten your game time. It&#8217;s a must to run whenever
                possible because there is a time limit and the faster you get
                through, the better score you&#8217;ll have.</em
